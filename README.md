# Cinegy KLV Decoder Library

Use this library to decode KLV data from MPEG transport streams. The library takes a dependency on the Cinegy Transport Stream Decoder Library (Apache 2 licensed).;

## How easy is it?

The library was designed to be simple to use and flexible. Use the Cinegy TS decoder to create packets of data from a stream or a file, and pass these packets to the KLV decoder and get results!

For example, you can use it to debug / view into the guts of an MXF file (the best example of a SMPTE KLV structure).

You can print live KLV decoding, and you can use the tool to generate input logs for 'big data' analysis (which is very cool).

See all of this in action inside the Cinegy TS Analyser tool here: [GitHub] [https://github.com/cinegy/tsanalyser]
